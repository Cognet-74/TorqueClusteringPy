# TorqueClusteringPy
This is a work-in-progress to replicate the TorqueClustering algorithm described in Jie Yang and Chin-Teng Lin, ‚ÄúAutonomous clustering by fast find of mass and distance peaks,‚Äù IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence (TPAMI), DOI: 10.1109/TPAMI.2025.3535743

It performs autonomous clustering by fast find of mass and distance peaks.

current status: core algorithm is mostly working but still dealing with issues in replicating all results for the complete dataset.

*NaN values for AMI occurred when EMI was very small (< 2.22e-16); NMI was used instead.

## Summary of Findings

### Successfully Processed Datasets (10/20)

- **Matching cluster count**: None of the processed datasets found the exact number of expected clusters
- **Close match**: Heterogeneous geometric (found 4 vs. expected 3), Unbalanced (found 2 vs. expected 3)
- **Largest discrepancies**: 
  - Highly overlapping: Found 3 vs. expected 15
  - Noisy: Found 54 vs. expected 5
  - Multi-objective 2: Found 15 vs. expected 4

### Failed Processing (10/20)

- **Data type casting errors**: 8 datasets (MNIST70k, Zoo, S.disease, Cell.track, CMU-PIE 11k, Reuters, YTF, COIL-100)
- **Memory allocation error**: 1 dataset (Shuttle)
- **File not found**: 1 dataset (Haberman)

### Performance Metrics

- **Best NMI**: Heterogeneous geometric (0.8935)
- **Best AC**: Unbalanced (0.9000)
- **Worst performer**: RNA-Seq (NMI: 0.0184, AC: 0.0087)
