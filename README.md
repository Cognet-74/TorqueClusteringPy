# TorqueClusteringPy
This is a work-in-progress to replicate the TorqueClustering algorithm described in Jie Yang and Chin-Teng Lin, “Autonomous clustering by fast find of mass and distance peaks,” IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence (TPAMI), DOI: 10.1109/TPAMI.2025.3535743

It performs autonomous clustering by fast find of mass and distance peaks.

current status: core algorithm is working but still dealing with issues in replicating all results for the complete dataset.
